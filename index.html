          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            POGO is Lowe’s new internal platform for managing purchase orders
            and inventory replenishment. With many different supply chain
            personas and over 2000 users relying on it, accuracy and timely
            communication are critical. A key issue emerged in creating purchase
            orders through the manual upload process: after uploading excel
            files, users received little to no feedback, causing confusion and
            repeated errors. I designed a progress bar feature that provides
            clear status updates, reducing redundant uploads and ensuring
            purchase orders are created with effieciency in mind
          </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Designing improvements for POGO came with its share of challenges.
              A major modernization effort was underway, requiring teams to
              shift from heavily customized code to a stricter design system.
              This added complexity, especially since multiple supply chain
              applications needed to stay aligned. With so many updates
              happening simultaneously, even small feature changes took longer
              to execute. Another challenge was the development environment.
              Each application had different technical limitations, and team
              bandwidth was low. This meant we had to carefully prioritize user
              problems that would deliver the greatest impact, remain feasible
              to build, and stay consistent with existing application flows.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
              We narrowed the scope to focus solely on the issues with manual
              uploads. I designed a progress bar pattern that provided users
              with clear feedback and visibility into the status of their file
              uploads. This ensured users understood what was happening in real
              time, reducing confusion and unnecessary resubmissions. The
              feature was built to align with the new design system guidelines
              while remaining flexible enough to support future use cases across
              other supply chain applications.

        <h2>Verifying the Problem</h2>

        <p>
          Among the many pain points in POGO, the manual upload workflow stood
          out. It was a critical step in creating purchase orders, yet users
          were left without feedback after submitting their files. This lack of
          visibility created confusion, led to unnecessary resubmissions, and
          slowed down the process across multiple teams. By reviewing user
          feedback and internal error reports, we confirmed that addressing this
          single issue could remove a major source of friction. Narrowing the
          scope allowed us to target a high-impact problem, reduce errors, and
          deliver value without overextending limited design and development
          resources.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="user-research section">
        <h2>Target Users</h2>
        <p>
          The primary users of this workflow included the Inventory
          Replenishment Senior Specialist (IRSS), the Senior Analyst Systems
          Support, and the Associate Inventory Planner. Each of these roles
          relied on manual uploads to create and manage purchase orders
          accurately and efficiently. Because their work directly affected
          vendors, transportation, and inventory flows, even small errors could
          have costly downstream effects. Focusing on these users allowed us to
          target a pain point at the core of daily operations, reduce avoidable
          mistakes, and improve overall confidence in the system.

          The main problem that interrupts the in-store associates workflow is
          having to contact the call center to make edits to customer accounts
          because their permissions are limited. Another big issues for pro
          associates is the fact that they are multi-tasking and having to go
          back and forth from the desktop to the aisles helping customers. They
          also have sales and sign-up targets on their minds. Having PXMP on
          mobile with give them more flexibility when assisting customers
          because they could at least stay out on the floor and complete task in
          a single location.

      <div class="app-audit section">
        <h2>Initial Designs</h2>
        <p>
          I began by exploring ways we already give visibility to the upload
          progress to keep the solution simple, while staying consistent with
          the new design system and other supply chain applications. The
          stakeholders involved also noted that they wanted to keep the workflow
          the same for the users. This included the ability to upload multiple
          files at once. The first concepts we attempted use a progess bar
          design pattern from a similar application that included status
          indicators through each of the validation steps. However, this is
          where the limitations of different applications made us pivot.

        />
      </div>

      <div class="app-audit section">
        <h2>Final Design and Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          Early reviews with product managers and developers helped refine the
          direction. The first thing we decided was that users will only be able
          to upload one file at a time. We convinced stakeholders that changes
          to the workflow were necessary to prevent minor errors, and we assured
          them that the benefits would out weight their worries. This way, we
          wouldn't have to use multiple progress bars in the design because that
          would create a problem with design consistency. Next, we learned from
          the developers that there are two validation points in this workflow
          instead of three, and the final one happens after a file has been
          uploaded.
        </p>

        <p>
          That made our initial designs with the progress steppers give a false
          since of completion. We decided that wouldn’t be a good experience to
          show the user that the system has completed these different steps only
          for it not to be true. [I need to get examples of the old designs].
          From there, we decided to strip the design pattern down to the bare
          minimum. Our final designs became more simplified and streamlined.
          Once the flows were polished, I created a prototype from it. Then it
          was time to perform a usability test on it.

          Despite the many request to update the internal tool to fit mobile
          devices, that wasn’t an implication that PXMP didn’t perform well with
          users. In fact, with a score of 89.05, it performs amazingly well!
          This indicates that larger, more systematic factors are at play when
          it comes to making this tool more effective.

      <div class="design-system section">
        <h2>User Testing and Readout</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted usability testing through interviews with seven
          participants across key supply chain roles: five Inventory
          Replenishment Senior Specialists (IRSS), one Associate Inventory
          Planner, and one Senior Analyst System Support. The business
          objectives were to decrease upload completion time and reduce
          ambiguity in the manual upload process. Research goals focused on
          providing visibility into upload progress, giving appropriate feedback
          to user actions, and observing impressions of the updated POGO
          designs.
        </p>

        <p>
          I partnered with our research team to write the testing scripts,
          designed the prototype used in the sessions, and personally moderated
          the test interviews. This allowed me to observe first-hand how
          participants interacted with the new design and capture their feedback
          in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The results were highly positive. Users responded well to the new
          progress bar feature, noting that visibility into file processing made
          the workflow significantly clearer, especially when working with
          larger files that required more time. There were secondary features we
          also tested, but had more to do with the modernized UI change than our
          specific issue. I collected all of the data and used Figma Slides to
          format the information to be suitable for the stakeholders. I
          presented the findings to our Director, Senior Product Managers, Lead
          Designers, and Buisness Partners. Below is the "Readout Report" used
          in the presentation.

          A mobile responsive approach to this transition is usually the
          simplest and easiest way to transition a desktop website or
          application to mobile. That goes for all parties involved. However, in
          this case, using two different systems leaves more room for errors and
          inconsistencies. At this point I was having serious doubts about the
          responsive approach, and that would eventually lead to the second
          pivot point. Which was determining the best approach for this
          transition: mobile responsive, mobile-optimized, or a hybrid option.

            Throughout this time of gaining a better understanding of our
            research and the pivots that came with it. There was a pleasant
            constant that kept everything aligned. That was the fact that this
            tool would still need to be redesigned for mobile devices. That
            meant we would need to prioritize the information and content to
            determine how to best use our limited screen size. A big task would
            be to redesign the large data heavy tables within PXMP. Using an
            analytic tool called New Relic, allowed us to see the numbers about
            how this tool is being used in real time.

            New Relic is a cloud-based software platform that helps businesses
            monitor, debug, and improve their applications and infrastructure.
            Here we used this tool to inform us on the most visited pages and
            tabs within PXMP. It also gave us an insight into the ways users
            look up customer information. Shown in the images below we can see
            that the purchase history tab is the most popular, and that customer
            accounts are found mainly with their phone numbers

          As I’ve pointed out before, transitioning data heavy elements and
          complex visuals to fit mobile screens sizes is one of the biggest
          task. The way to solve this issue is through prioritizing the
          information that’s most essential to the user and their workflow. We
          learned from New Relic that purchase history is one of the most
          frequent tabs that our users navigate too. For example, looking up old
          purchases to verify receipts from rewards. Understanding the why
          behind these different workflows are key to understanding what
          information we should prioritize.

          In the example above, so much information is clearly visible, and
          added features like filtering help find specific items faster. On a
          mobile device the visibility will decrease drastically, which can
          increase the time it takes to complete task. This is the reason I
          would not only take qualitative research approaches to understanding
          how users complete task, but quantitative approaches to learn what
          aspects of the task we should focus on. I would use Tree Testing and
          Card Sorting methods to get a complete picture of their terminology,
          grouping structures, and informational hierarchies.

          I believe the best approach would be to make PXMP mobile-optimized
          rather than mobile responsive. Although my opinion should be looked
          into further and discussed more, this is the direction I’m leaning
          too. Considering the current long term goals, the complexity of the
          workflows, user needs, and engineering resources the pros out weigh
          the cons. There isn’t an immediate press for time, and given the fact
          that more associates will use the tool, it would be wise to have an
          internal tool that is intuitive and streamlined. If PXMP is made
          responsive as is, the mobile experience will be clunky and full of
          friction. Add that to the quick timeouts that associates experience
          will only slow the process down further. This will only lead to more
          frustration and more negative feedback for the associates.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            This project demonstrated how a focused design improvement can have
            an outsized impact on both users and business outcomes. By
            addressing a single pain point in the manual upload process, we
            reduced ambiguity, built user confidence, and set a foundation for
            more consistent and scalable patterns within POGO. The key takeaway
            was that even small, well-scoped features such as a progress bar can
            meaningfully improve workflows when grounded in user needs and
            aligned with system guidelines. Going forward, the same approach can
            be extended to other high-friction areas of POGO and related supply
            chain applications, ensuring that future enhancements deliver
            clarity, consistency, and measurable value.
